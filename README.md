## Install

**Linux x64 — v0.1.0**

The repository is private, so installation uses an authenticated GitHub CLI
session:

```sh
gh api -H 'Accept: application/vnd.github.raw+json' \
  'repos/Hunter-124/chudcode/contents/install.sh?ref=v0.1.0' | sh
```

From an existing checkout, run `./install.sh` instead. The installer downloads
the `chudcode-linux-x64` release artifact and installs the primary command
plus all three compatibility links:

```text
chudcode       primary command
chudware-code  compatibility alias
chcode         short alias
chudcode            legacy alias
```

Existing `~/.chudcode` configuration, profiles, sessions, and `chudcode`-based scripts
continue to work unchanged.

### Shell completions

`chudcode` generates its own completion scripts for **bash**, **zsh**, and **fish** from the live command/flag metadata, so they never drift from the actual CLI. Subcommands, flags, and enum values complete statically; model names (`--model`, `--smol`, `--slow`, `--plan`) resolve against the bundled model catalog and `--resume` against your on-disk sessions.

```sh
# zsh — add to ~/.zshrc (or write the output into a file on your $fpath)
eval "$(chudcode completions zsh)"

# bash — add to ~/.bashrc
eval "$(chudcode completions bash)"

# fish
chudcode completions fish > ~/.config/fish/completions/chudcode.fish
```

## Every tool, _benchmaxxed_.

Edits that land on the first attempt. Reads that summarize files instead of dumping their content. Searches that return instantly. Pick any model — Chudcode will get it right.

| model            | metric       | what                                                                  |
| ---------------- | ------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Grok Code Fast 1 | 6.7% → 68.3% | Tenfold lift the moment the edit format stops eating the model alive. |
| Gemini 3 Flash   | +5 pp        | Over str_replace — beats Google's own best attempt at the format.     |
| Grok 4 Fast      | −61% tokens  | Output collapses once the retry loop on bad diffs disappears.         |
| MiniMax          | 2.1×         | Pass rate more than doubles. Same weights, same prompt.               |

- `read` : summarized snippets · ideal defaults · selector hit rate
- `grep` : fastest in the west
- `lsp` : everything your IDE knows, the agent knows
- `prompts` : adjusted relentlessly for each model

## The Chud _you love_, with **batteries included**.

Originally built on [Mario Zechner](https://github.com/mariozechner)'s wonderful [Chud](https://github.com/badlogic/chudcode-mono), Chudcode adds everything you're missing.

### 01 · Code execution w/ tool-calling

Most harnesses give the agent a Python sandbox and call it done. Ours runs persistent Python and a Bun worker, and either kernel can call back into the agent's own tools — read, search, task — over a loopback bridge. The agent loads a CSV with tool.read from inside Python, charts it from JavaScript, and never leaves the cell.

![Chudcode TUI running Python code and rendering a chart.](assets/python.webp)

### 02 · LSP wired into every write

Ask for a rename and you get a rename. The call goes through workspace/willRenameFiles, so re-exports, barrel files, and aliased imports update before the file moves. Everything your IDE knows, the agent knows.

![Chudcode TUI with TypeScript and Biome language servers active.](assets/lspv.webp)

_[Read the LSP config docs](docs/lsp-config.md)_

### 03 · Drives a real debugger

A C binary segfaults: the agent attaches lldb, steps to the bad pointer, reads the frame. A Go service hangs: it attaches dlv and walks the goroutines. A Python process is wedged: debugpy, pause, inspect, evaluate. Most agents are still sprinkling print statements.

![Chudcode TUI: a live lldb-dap session against a native binary at /tmp/chudcode-native/demo. Adapter=lldb-dap, Status=stopped, Frame=xorshift32, Instruction pointer 0x10000055C, Location demo.c:6:10. Debug scopes and Debug variables cards show locals (x = 57351) and the agent confirms the math: x went from 7 → 57351 (= 7 ^ (7<<13)).](https://chudware.sh/clips/dap-poster.webp)

_[Watch the capture ↗](https://chudware.sh/clips/dap.mp4)_

### 04 · Time-traveling stream rules

Your rules sit dormant until the model goes off-script. A regex match aborts the stream mid-token, injects the rule as a system reminder, and retries from the same point. You get course-correction without paying context tax on every turn. Injections survive compaction, so the fix sticks.

![Chudcode TUI: agent reading src.rs and about to write Box::leak when the request aborts (red `Error: Request was aborted`), an amber `⚠ Injecting rule: box-leak` card injects the rule body `Don't reach for Box::leak in production code paths`, and the agent then course-corrects by proposing `Arc<str>` and asking the user to confirm.](https://chudware.sh/clips/ttsr-poster.webp)

_[Watch the capture ↗](https://chudware.sh/clips/ttsr.mp4)_

### 05 · First-class subagents

Split a job across workers and get typed results back. task fans out into isolated worktrees, each worker runs its own tool surface, and the final yield is a schema-validated object the parent reads directly. No prose to parse, no merge conflicts between siblings, no orphaned edits.

![Chudcode TUI showing `task` spawning two subagents `ComponentsExports` and `RoutesExports`, the constraints block requiring an IRC DM between peers, the per-subagent status cards with cost and duration, and a final Findings section listing both exports plus an honest 'IRC coordination note' about a one-sided handshake.](https://chudware.sh/clips/irc-poster.webp)

_[Watch the capture ↗](https://chudware.sh/clips/irc.mp4)_

Watch the fan-out while it runs: `Alt+A` opens [Agent Hub](docs/agent-hub.md), where the roster shows current activity and usage for every subagent. Open one to read its live transcript, type a steering message, revive a parked worker, or kill a stuck one without aborting the parent session.

### 06 · A second model, watching every turn.

Pair a reviewer model to the 'advisor' role and it reads every turn the main agent takes, injecting notes inline — a quiet aside, a concern, or a hard blocker. It runs on its own context and its own model, so it catches what the doer rushed past. The main agent sees the note and course-corrects, or tells you why it won't.

![Chudcode TUI: /advisor status shows the advisor running on openai-codex/gpt-5.5; after the main agent scopes a catch to ENOENT instead of swallowing every error, an amber 'Advisor 1 note (concern)' card warns the fix no longer matches the user's literal acceptance criterion.](https://chudware.sh/clips/advisor-poster.webp)

_[Watch the capture ↗](https://chudware.sh/clips/advisor.mp4)_

### 07 · Hand someone the link, they're in.

/collab puts your live session on a relay and hands back a link — and a QR. A teammate joins from another terminal with Chudcode join, or just opens it in a browser. Share read-write to pair on the same agent, or /collab view for a read-only link anyone can watch but no one can steer. Frames are sealed client-side; the relay never sees your keys.

![Chudcode TUI: /collab view prints 'Collab session started!' with a Chudcode join command, a my.chudware.sh browser link, the note 'Anyone with this link can watch the session but cannot prompt the agent', and a large scannable QR code.](https://chudware.sh/clips/collab-poster.webp)

_[Watch the capture ↗](https://chudware.sh/clips/collab.mp4)_

### 08 · Read a pdf on arxiv, why not?

web_search chains twenty-three ranked providers and hands whatever URLs it finds straight to read. Arxiv PDFs, GitHub pages, Stack Overflow threads come back as structured markdown with anchors intact — the same tool surface you use on local files. Cite, follow, quote, never lose where you came from.

![Chudcode TUI: web_search returns 10 ranked Perplexity sources for inference-time compute scaling, the agent picks an arxiv paper, calls read https://arxiv.org/pdf/2604.10739v1, and summarizes the paper's headline result with real numbers.](https://chudware.sh/clips/web-poster.webp)

_[Watch the capture ↗](https://chudware.sh/clips/web.mp4)_

### 09 · Unapologetically native. Even on Windows.

Other agents shell out to rg, grep, find, and bash. On many machines those binaries don't exist, and on the ones where they do, every call costs a fork-exec round-trip. Chudcode links the real implementations into the process. ripgrep, glob, find: in-process. brush is the bash — with sessions that survive across calls, and 58 command-line utilities (ls, sed, sort, xargs, even jq) ported into the builtins crate and run in-process, zero fork/exec. The same Chudcode binary runs on macOS, Linux, and Windows — no WSL bridge.

### 10 · Code review with priorities and a verdict

Get a clear verdict on whether the change ships, with every issue ranked P0 through P3 and scored for confidence. /review spawns dedicated reviewer subagents that sweep branches, single commits, or uncommitted work in parallel. You tackle what blocks release first; nothing important hides in a wall of prose.

### 11 · Hashline: edit by content hash

Perfect edits, fewer tokens. The model points at anchors instead of retyping the lines it wants to change, so whitespace battles and string-not-found loops just stop happening. Edit a stale file and the anchors diverge — we reject the patch before it corrupts anything. Grok 4 Fast spends 61% fewer output tokens on the same work.

### 12 · GitHub is just another filesystem

Other harnesses bolt on gh_issue_view, gh_pr_view, gh_search — each with its own parameters the agent has to learn and you have to debug. We skipped that. read already handles paths; PRs are paths. One interface to teach the model, one surface to keep correct.

### 13 · Memory the agent curates

The agent remembers your codebase between sessions. It writes facts mid-run with retain, captures reusable lessons with learn, pulls them back with recall, and compresses each session into a mental model that loads on the first turn of the next one. Pick the engine with `memory.backend` — local, Hindsight, or Mnemo. Project-scoped by default, so what it learns about this repo stays with this repo.

### 14 · ACP: editor-drivable agent

Run Chudcode inside Zed and you get the same agent you drive from the terminal — reading the buffer you're actually looking at, writing through the editor's save path, spawning shells in the editor's terminal. Destructive tools pause for a permission prompt you can answer once and forget. No bridge, no plugin, no second brain to keep in sync.

### 15 · Inherits what your other tools already wrote

Every other agent ships an importer and expects you to convert. Chudcode reads the eight formats already on disk in their native shape — Cursor MDC, Cline .clinerules, Codex AGENTS.md, Copilot applyTo, and the rest. No migration script, no YAML-to-TOML port, no "supported subset" footnotes. The config your team wrote last quarter still works tonight.

### 16 · Chudcode commit: atomic splits, validated messages

chudcode reads the working tree through git_overview, git_file_diff, and git_hunk, then splits unrelated changes into atomic commits ordered by their dependencies. Cycles are rejected before anything is written. Source files score above tests, docs, and configs, so the headline commit is the one that matters. Lock files are excluded from analysis entirely.

### 17 · Read PRs. _Walk skills._ Pull JSON out of subagents.

Sixteen internal schemes — `pr://`, `issue://`, `agent://`, `skill://`, `ssh://`, and the rest — resolve transparently inside every FS-shaped tool the agent already calls. `read pr://1428` returns the same shape as `read src/foo.ts`. `grep` walks a diff like a directory. `agent://<id>/findings.0.path` pulls a field out of a subagent's output by path.

### 18 · Conflict resolution, made easy.

Each merge conflict becomes one URL. The agent writes `@theirs`, `@ours`, or `@base` to `conflict://N` and the file resolves cleanly. Bulk form: `conflict://*`.

![Chudcode TUI: ✓ Read src/session.ts (⚠ 1 conflict), then ✓ Write conflict://1 · 1 line with content @theirs, then a confirmation 'Resolved.'](https://chudware.sh/clips/conflict-poster.webp)

_[Watch the capture ↗](https://chudware.sh/clips/conflict.mp4)_

### 19 · Preview, then accept.

`ast_edit` returns a _(proposed)_ card with the replacement count. The change is staged. The agent writes a one-line reason to `xd://resolve`; the TUI turns it into an **Accept** card and the disk move happens — atomic, all or nothing.

![Chudcode TUI: ✓ AST Edit: console.log($X) (proposed) 3 replacements · 1 file, then ✓ Accept: 3 replacements in 1 file (AST Edit), followed by 'Applied 3 replacements in src/auth.ts.'](https://chudware.sh/clips/codemod-poster.webp)

_[Watch the capture ↗](https://chudware.sh/clips/codemod.mp4)_

### 20 · Drives a _real browser_. _Or your Slack?_

Stealth's on by default, so pages see a normal user instead of a headless bot. The same API drives any Electron app in place — point it at Slack and the agent reads your DMs the way it reads the web. Or skip the sandbox entirely: the browser relay extension lets the agent adopt the Chrome tabs you already have open, without stealing focus.

### 21 · Hands on the desktop itself

`computer` runs persistent JavaScript against the real host: enumerate windows and displays, capture screenshots, send native input, walk the OS accessibility tree, touch the clipboard. Not the browser tool, no DOM — the same desktop you're looking at.

## Whatever the task needs, _it's already in the box_.

31 tools live in the same namespace as `read` and `bash`. Pin the active set with `--tools read,edit,bash,…`; rarely used discoverable tools stay behind `xd://` devices. `read xd://` lists them, and `write xd://<tool>` runs one when `tools.xdev` is enabled.

**Files & search**

- `read` — files, dirs, archives, SQLite, PDFs, notebooks, URLs, remote `ssh://` paths, and internal `://` schemes through one path.
- `write` — create or overwrite a file, archive entry, or SQLite row.
- `edit` — hashline patches with content-hash anchors and stale-anchor recovery.
- `ast_edit` — structural rewrites previewed before apply, via ast-grep.
- `ast_grep` — structural code queries over 50+ tree-sitter grammars.
- `grep` — regex over files, globs, and internal URLs.
- `glob` — glob-based path lookup; reach for `grep` when you need content matches.

**Runtime**

- `bash` — workspace shell with 46 in-process coreutils, optional PTY, and background-job dispatch.
- `eval` — persistent Python and JavaScript cells with shared prelude and tool re-entry.

**Code intelligence**

- `lsp` — diagnostics, navigation, symbols, renames, code actions, raw requests.
- `debug` — drive a DAP session — breakpoints, stepping, threads, stack, variables.
- `security_scan` — plan and run native security reviews; drives Codex Security cloud scans.

**Coordination**

- `task` — fan out subagents in parallel, optionally workspace-isolated.
- `hub` — message live agents, wait on or cancel background jobs, and supervise long-running processes.
- `todo` — ordered mutations over the session todo list with phase tracking.
- `ask` — structured follow-up questions for interactive runs.

**Desktop & web**

- `browser` — Puppeteer tabs over headless Chromium, CDP-attached apps, or your own Chrome via the relay.
- `computer` — persistent JS against the host desktop: windows, screenshots, native input, AX tree, clipboard.
- `web_search` — one query across configured providers, returning answer plus citations.
- `github` — GitHub CLI ops — repo, PR, issues, code search, Actions run-watch.
- `generate_image` — generate or edit raster images via Gemini, GPT, or xAI Grok image models.
- `inspect_image` — vision-model analysis of a local image file.
- `tts` — text-to-speech via xAI Grok Voice — five built-in voices, WAV or MP3.

**Memory & skills**

- `checkpoint` — mark conversation state for a later collapse-and-report.
- `rewind` — prune exploratory context, keep a concise report.
- `retain` — queue durable facts into the active memory bank.
- `recall` — search the memory bank for raw memories.
- `reflect` — synthesize an answer over the bank.
- `memory_edit` — update, forget, or invalidate stored memories by id.
- `learn` — capture a reusable lesson; optionally promote it into a managed skill.
- `manage_skill` — create, update, or delete an isolated managed skill.

Setting-gated, off by default: `github`, `security_scan`, `generate_image`, `tts`, `checkpoint`, `rewind`, and the memory tools (`retain`/`recall`/`reflect`/`memory_edit`, per `memory.backend`). `inspect_image` activates automatically when the active model can't see.

### Prompt controls

Six standalone, lowercase words opt a turn into specialized agent behavior:

- `ultrathink` — request careful multi-step reasoning and the highest supported automatic thinking effort.
- `orchestrate` — run substantial independent work through parallel subagents and verify each phase.
- `workflowz` — build a deterministic multi-subagent workflow with the active `task` tool.
- `ultragoon` — research the request in parallel first, then settle the load-bearing decisions with you before building.
- `tokenmaxxing` — route the turn onto the strongest harness the task actually needs, with evidence for every claim.
- `autobot` — grant standing authority for the request: best judgement, no permission checkpoints, finished work.

They trigger only in prose, not inside code spans, fenced code blocks, XML/HTML sections, identifiers, or paths. See [Magic keywords](docs/magic-keywords.md) for exact matching rules and configuration.

### Session controls

Slash commands shift how a whole session runs:

- `/vibe` — enter [Vibe mode](docs/vibe-mode.md): act as a director driving persistent `fast`/`good` worker sessions with a `read`-only toolset.
- `/fresh` — reset the provider stream state (stale prompt cache, wedged stream) without changing the local transcript. See [Session operations](docs/session-operations-export-share-fork-resume.md#fresh).

## Sixty-plus providers, a thousand models, _one /model away_.

Ten roles route work by intent. `default` for normal turns. `smol` for cheap subagent fan-out. `slow` for deep reasoning. `plan` for plan mode. `commit` for changelogs. Plus `vision`, `designer`, `task`, `advisor`, and `tiny` for their namesakes. Override at launch with `--smol`, `--slow`, or `--plan`; cycle through the configured models for the active role with `Ctrl+P`. Swap the active model mid-session with the `/model` slash command.

Auth tags below: `oauth` signs in with your provider account, `plan` routes through a coding-plan subscription, `local` runs against a local server with the key optional.

### Frontier APIs

Direct APIs and gateways. Mix providers per role.

Anthropic `oauth` · OpenAI · OpenAI Codex `oauth` · Google Gemini · Google Vertex · Google Antigravity `oauth` · xAI · SuperGrok `oauth` · DeepSeek · Mistral · Groq · Cerebras · Fireworks · Together · Baseten · DeepInfra · Hugging Face · NVIDIA · Meta · Amazon Bedrock · Azure OpenAI · SiliconFlow · GMI Cloud · CoreWeave · Sakana AI · OpenRouter · Synthetic · Vercel AI Gateway · Cloudflare AI Gateway · Wafer Serverless

### Coding plans

Subscription-routed. `/login` attaches the session.

Cursor `oauth` · GitHub Copilot `oauth` · GitLab Duo · Devin `oauth` · Kimi Code `plan` · Moonshot · MiniMax Coding Plan `plan` · MiniMax Coding Plan CN `plan` · Alibaba Coding Plan `plan` · Qwen Portal `oauth` · Z.AI / GLM Coding Plan `plan` · Zhipu Coding Plan `plan` · Xiaomi MiMo · Qianfan · Umans `plan` · NanoGPT · Novita · Venice · Kilo · ZenMux · OpenCode Go · OpenCode Zen

### Run it yourself

OpenAI-compatible `/v1/models`. Local instances skip the key.

Ollama `local` · Ollama Cloud · LM Studio `local` · llama.cpp `local` · vLLM `local` · LiteLLM

### Custom OpenAI-compatible providers

Define custom providers in `~/.chudcode/agent/models.yml`:

```yaml
providers:
  spark:
    baseUrl: http://192.168.10.223:8000/v1
    api: openai-completions
    apiKey: dummy
    models:
      - id: minimax-m3
        name: MiniMax M3
        contextWindow: 100000
        maxTokens: 32000
```

Run `chudcode models spark` to verify discovery. Then run `chudcode setup` and choose the model in the default-model step, or open `/model` in a session and assign it to the `default` role.

To preconfigure the default without the picker, add the selector to `~/.chudcode/agent/config.yml`:

```yaml
modelRoles:
  default: spark/minimax-m3
```

### Four knobs that make routing useful

- **Custom providers** — Declare anything that speaks `openai-completions`, `openai-responses`, `openai-codex-responses`, `azure-openai-responses`, `anthropic-messages`, `bedrock-converse-stream`, `google-generative-ai`, `google-gemini-cli`, or `google-vertex` in `~/.chudcode/agent/models.yml`.
- **Fallback chains** — Per-role or per-model chains under `retry.fallbackChains`. When the primary throws 429s or hits a quota wall, the next entry takes the rest of the turn — restored on cooldown.
- **Path-scoped models** — Scope `enabledModels` and `disabledProviders` entries to a `path:` prefix to pin a different model set on one repo without touching the global config. Scoped entries cover the path and everything under it.
- **Round-robin credentials** — Stack API keys per provider and the runtime rotates with session affinity and per-credential backoff. Useful when one key would burn its quota by lunch.

Full provider & routing reference at [chudware.sh/docs/providers](https://chudware.sh/docs/providers).

## Twenty-three backends. _One tool the agent already knows_.

`web_search` is built in, not bolted on. `auto` walks a twenty-three-provider chain; pin one by name if you already pay for it. Behind every hit, site-aware extraction turns GitHub, registries, arXiv, Stack Overflow, and docs into structured markdown — anchors and link targets survive.

### Search providers

Twenty-three backends. Pin one, or let `auto` walk the chain in order.

| provider     | auth                                      |
| ------------ | ----------------------------------------- |

| `kimi`       | `/login kimi-code` or search key          |
| `parallel`   | `PARALLEL_API_KEY`                        |
| `synthetic`  | `SYNTHETIC_API_KEY`                       |

### Specialised handlers

The agent gets structured content, not stripped HTML.

- **Code hosts** — github, gitlab
- **Package registries** — npm, PyPI, crates.io, Hex, Hackage, NuGet, Maven, RubyGems, Packagist, pub.dev, Go packages
- **Research sources** — arxiv, semantic scholar
- **Forums** — stack overflow, reddit, hn
- **Docs** — mdn, readthedocs, docs.rs

Pages convert to markdown with link structure intact. The agent can cite, follow, and quote without losing anchors.

### Security databases

Vuln lookups answer with vendor data, not blog summaries.

- **NVD** — national vulnerability database
- **OSV** — open source vuln feed
- **CISA KEV** — known exploited vulns

## Roughly **~80,000** lines of Rust, doing the work other harnesses shell out for.

Six crates, one platform-tagged N-API addon. Search, shell, AST, highlight, PTY, desktop control, image decode, BPE counting — all in-process on the libuv pool. No fork/exec on the hot path. Another ~80k lines ride along vendored: the brush bash fork, plus 58 command-line utilities — coreutils, findutils, sed, jq, ripgrep-backed grep, fd, diff, moreutils — ported into the builtins crate and compiled straight into the shell.

- Crates: `chud-natives`, `chud-shell`, `chud-ast`, `chud-iso`, `chud-voice`, `chud-walker`
- Published platforms: `linux-x64`, `darwin-x64`, `win32-x64` — x64 Linux ships dual AVX2 and baseline binaries; other architectures remain locally buildable but are not part of the current release gate

Per crate, code lines only:

## Four entry points: _interactive_, _one-shot_, RPC, and ACP.

Same engine, four wrappers. `chudcode` runs the TUI. `chudcode -p` answers a single prompt and exits. The Node SDK embeds the session in your process. `chudcode --mode rpc` and `chudcode acp` hand the wheel to another program over stdio.

### Interactive — when in doubt, the agent asks

The TUI is the default surface. Tool calls render as cards, edits preview before they land, and ambiguity routes through the `ask` tool — a structured option picker the agent can call mid-turn. The keyboard handles the rest.

The same prompt cards surface over ACP, so editors get the picker without writing one.

![Chudcode TUI showing a multi-select question from the ask tool.](assets/ask.webp)

### SDK — embed in Node

`@chudware/coding-agent`

Node and TypeScript hosts pull the engine in directly. The package exposes `ModelRegistry`, `SessionManager`, `createAgentSession`, and `discoverAuthStorage`; the session emits typed events you subscribe to.

```ts
import {
  ModelRegistry,
  SessionManager,
  createAgentSession,
  discoverAuthStorage,
} from "@chudware/coding-agent";

const auth = await discoverAuthStorage();
const models = new ModelRegistry(auth);
await models.refresh();

const { session } = await createAgentSession({
  sessionManager: SessionManager.inMemory(),
  authStorage: auth,
  modelRegistry: models,
});
await session.prompt("list .ts files");
```

### RPC — drive over stdio

`chudcode --mode rpc`

For non-Node embedders, or when you want process isolation. NDJSON commands in, response and event frames out. `--mode rpc-ui` adds tool cards, selectors, and dialogs as `extension_ui_request` frames the host must answer.

```
$ chudcode --mode rpc --no-session
> {"id":"r1","type":"prompt","message":"list .ts files"}
< {"id":"r1","type":"response", ...}
> {"id":"r2","type":"set_model","provider":"anthropic","modelId":"sonnet-4.5"}
> {"id":"r3","type":"abort"}
```

### ACP — speak to editors

`chudcode acp`

The [Agent Client Protocol](https://github.com/zed-industries/agent-client-protocol) over JSON-RPC. When the editor advertises capabilities, tool I/O routes through it and writes are gated by `session/request_permission`.

| Chudcode tool     | ACP route                           |
| ------------ | ----------------------------------- |
| `bash`       | `terminal/create + terminal/output` |
| `read`       | `fs/read_text_file`                 |
| `write`      | `fs/write_text_file`                |
| `edit, bash` | `session/request_permission`        |

## A harness worth keeping is one you _don't_ outgrow.

Pick it up at **[chudware.sh](https://chudware.sh)**.

chudcode is a fork of [Chud](https://github.com/badlogic/chudcode-mono) by [Mario Zechner](https://github.com/mariozechner), rewritten as a coding-first surface: sessions, subagents, slash commands, extensions — all TypeScript, all MIT, all on [GitHub](https://github.com/Hunter-124/chudcode). Shape it from config, hook it from outside, or read the source when you need to.

### Primitives

An extension is a TypeScript module. Same tool API, same slash-command registry, same hotkey table, same TUI primitives the built-ins use. Nothing is reserved.

### Discovery

On first run Chudcode inherits whatever is already on disk: rules, skills, and MCP servers from `.claude`, `.cursor`, `.windsurf`, `.gemini`, `.codex`, `.cline`, `.github/copilot`, and `.vscode`. No migration script.

### Extensibility

Ask Chudcode to write the piece you're missing, then `/reload-plugins`. Keep it local, ship it in a `marketplace`, or publish it to npm.

## Philosophy

chudcode is a fork of [chudcode-mono](https://github.com/badlogic/chudcode-mono) by [Mario Zechner](https://github.com/mariozechner), extended with a batteries-included coding workflow.

Key ideas:

- Keep interactive terminal-first UX for real coding work
- Include practical built-ins (tools, sessions, branching, subagents, extensibility)
- Make advanced behavior configurable rather than hidden

---

## Development

### Getting started from source

Fresh clones need both workspace dependencies and the local Rust/N-API addon before the source CLI can start.

```sh
bun setup
bun dev
```

`bun setup` installs Bun workspaces and builds `@chudware/natives`. Re-run `bun run build:native` after changing Rust crates or `packages/natives`.

Nix users get the pinned Bun and Rust toolchains plus all native build dependencies:

```sh
nix develop
bun setup
bun dev
```

Build and smoke-test the distributable Nix package with `nix build .#chudcode`. Wayland screencast support is off by default (linking libpipewire adds ~750 MB of runtime closure); enable it with `chudcode.override { withWaylandScreencast = true; }`. `nix/bun.nix` is generated only when `bun.lock` changes; releases regenerate it automatically. For dependency changes, run:

```sh
bun run gen:nix
```

The command uses `bun2nix` from `nix develop` when available, otherwise enters the development shell through Nix, then falls back to the pinned `bunx bun2nix@2.1.2`. Do not edit `nix/bun.nix` manually.

For a non-interactive smoke check:

```sh
bun dev -- --version
```

### Debug Command

`/debug` opens tools for debugging, reporting, and profiling.
